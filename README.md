# chrome-pseudobookmark
This Chrome extension will create an additional Add Bookmark button with its own separate storage location.

Ctrl+Shift+E opens the options page.

Press the button to add the page.
The button disappears on pages with added URLs.
The options page presents the URLs as hyperlinks. You can also export them as markdown or delete all.

Ideally, this extension could be duplicated to create many Add Bookmark buttons, all corresponding to separate folders.
