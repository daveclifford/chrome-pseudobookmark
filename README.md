Create additional "add bookmark" buttons with their own storage

Ctrl+Shift+E opens the options page.

Press the button to add the page.
The button disappears on pages with added url.
The options page presents the urls as links. You can also export as markdown and delete all.

Ideally, this could be used to create many Add Bookmark buttons, all corresponding to separate folders.
